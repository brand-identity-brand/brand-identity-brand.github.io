# The Next Move

Status: architectural direction for the preproduction rewrite of `@brand-identity-brand/os`

## Mission

`@brand-identity-brand/os` is a portable React application runtime that separates application ownership from presentation.

Applications own their internal state. The runtime owns application identity, lifecycle, and the relationships between application views. Shells, desktop environments, and window managers decide where and how those views appear.

A desktop environment and a window manager are means of presenting the runtime. They are not the mission itself.

The purpose of the package is to let one application model be projected through desktop, mobile, embedded, nested, or future presentation systems without making any one of those systems the owner of the application.

## Why This Project Exists

The project began as a desktop environment because a desktop makes application relationships visible. Windows expose application identity, parent-child relationships, focus, ordering, hiding, restoration, and multiple simultaneous views. Building the desktop first was a practical way to discover the runtime underneath it.

The valuable result is not merely a collection of draggable React windows. It is a model in which applications, application instances, presentation surfaces, and the rendered component tree are different things.

That separation creates the possibility of:

- presenting the same application through different shells;
- giving one application instance more than one view;
- moving a view without moving application ownership;
- supporting nested desktops, portals, workspaces, and embedded application hosts;
- letting desktop and mobile interfaces refer to the same application identity;
- restoring runtime and presentation relationships independently of application state;
- replacing the window manager without rewriting the applications;
- allowing an application to choose where its immediate child surfaces are projected.

The prototype was written through rapid experiments. Its duplicate files, temporary names, hard-coded roots, incomplete APIs, and partially explored state systems are evidence of discovery, not the desired package structure. The preproduction rewrite should preserve the architectural discoveries without preserving every experimental implementation decision.

## The Most Valuable Architectural Idea

The React tree should be a projection of the runtime model, not the only place where the runtime exists.

The prototype already points toward three related collections:

- an application-type registry that resolves a type identifier to a React implementation;
- application-instance records that give running applications stable identity and lifecycle;
- presentation-surface records that associate a view with an application and place it relative to other surfaces.

This is why relational-database thinking is useful even when the implementation is an in-memory store rather than SQL. A surface refers to an application through a stable identifier. A child surface refers to its parent. A workspace contains ordered surfaces. A renderer queries those relationships and projects them into React.

The relationships are the durable architecture. The current DOM arrangement is one possible result of those relationships.

This model makes it possible to ask useful questions without inspecting the React component tree: Which surfaces present this application? Which surfaces belong to this workspace? Which application owns this child view? Which view should receive focus? Can this desktop projection be replaced by a mobile projection?

The model should remain small and normalized. Presentation details should not become application data, and application internals should not become runtime data.

## Application State Ownership

The runtime should not attempt to own or interpret application state.

An application may use local React state, its own Zustand store, a state machine, a server, a database, a collaborative document, or any other state system. It may choose to persist, synchronize, hydrate, or discard that state. Those choices belong to the application.

The runtime only needs enough information to identify and host the application. It may provide an application identifier, launch metadata, lifecycle notifications, and host capabilities, but the application remains responsible for the meaning and storage of its state.

If several surfaces present the same application instance, the application must place shared state somewhere that outlives any one view. That state is still application-owned. The runtime supplies the common application identifier; the application decides how views associated with that identifier share data.

Window state is different from application state. Position, size, visibility, focus order, workspace, parent surface, and presentation mode are concerns of the presentation system. A desktop window manager may own them. A mobile renderer may replace them with navigation position, sheet mode, or route history. The generic runtime should not assume that every surface is a desktop window.

The experimental `useKernelState` direction should therefore not define the core runtime. If a future persistence adapter is useful, it must be optional, opaque to the runtime, and clearly owned by the application.

## The Window Manager Is Intentionally Influential

Applications that use the runtime's full capabilities will be written for its application-host protocol. This influence is not automatically a design flaw. Every application platform defines lifecycle, rendering, navigation, capability, and communication contracts.

The real requirement is to make that influence explicit, small, and stable.

Applications should depend on a public host contract rather than raw Zustand stores, internal renderer names, hard-coded root IDs, or knowledge of how the desktop shell happens to be implemented. The contract may allow an application to open a surface, close a surface, request focus, inspect its own identity, and place an outlet for immediate child surfaces.

The package should be opinionated about the host protocol while remaining replaceable at the presentation layer.

## Intentional Immediate-Child Projection

The prototype's most unusual decision is that an application can decide where its immediate child windows are rendered. This replaced a single recursive god-renderer with intentional recursion distributed through application-defined outlets.

That idea should be preserved.

It enables nested desktops, application-owned subwindow regions, portals, split interfaces, embedded shells, and alternate presentation layouts. It also makes the runtime different from a conventional flat desktop window manager.

The preproduction version should formalize this as a generic surface outlet. An application that wants to host child surfaces places an outlet in its layout. The active shell supplies the renderer used by that outlet. A desktop shell can render children as windows; a mobile shell can render them as routes or sheets; an embedded shell can render them inside a bounded region.

Applications should not import a desktop-specific child-window renderer. They should declare a presentation outlet through the React runtime adapter.

This preserves the power of the experimental architecture while removing accidental coupling to its current implementation.

## Architectural Assessment

The core concept is strong. It is small, coherent, and capable of supporting behavior that ordinary component composition does not naturally provide.

The architecture is interesting because it treats UI placement as data and makes rendering a projection. It is unusual because child presentation is intentionally delegated back to applications through outlets. It can be effective because this creates real composability rather than forcing every application into one global desktop scene.

The current implementation is not yet clean enough to expand indefinitely. Its conceptual structure is cleaner than its source structure. Naming is overloaded, lifecycle operations cross independent stores, prototype code remains beside active code, and applications currently reach too far into runtime internals.

The preproduction rewrite can be clean and expandable if it establishes a strict dependency direction, a small vocabulary, atomic lifecycle commands, explicit invariants, and one stable application-host protocol.

## Vocabulary for Preproduction

The rewrite should use these terms consistently:

- **Application type**: a registered kind of application and its React implementation.
- **Application instance**: a running identity of an application type. It does not contain application-owned state.
- **Surface**: a presentation of an application instance. A surface is generic and is not necessarily a desktop window.
- **Parent surface**: the surface whose application layout provides the outlet for an immediate child surface.
- **Workspace**: an ordered presentation context containing surfaces.
- **Shell**: the top-level interface that selects and composes a presentation adapter.
- **Presentation adapter**: the system that interprets a surface as a desktop window, mobile route, sheet, panel, or embedded view.
- **Surface outlet**: an application-selected location where immediate child surfaces are projected.
- **Host API**: the stable capabilities exposed to applications.
- **Runtime snapshot**: serializable application identity and surface relationship data, excluding application-owned state and React component functions.

The word **kernel** should be reserved for the headless runtime core if it remains useful at all. A visible inspector should be named as an inspector or developer tool, not as the kernel itself. The word **driver** should be used only for genuine adapters. React components that resolve or render data should be named renderers, views, outlets, or providers.

## Target Architecture

The package should have four directional layers.

### 1. Headless runtime core

The core owns application identity, surface identity, lifecycle, relationships, validation, and serializable snapshots. It must not import React or desktop components. It should expose atomic commands rather than exposing store mutation directly.

### 2. React runtime adapter

The React layer provides context, selectors, application resolution, surface outlets, error boundaries, and host hooks. It converts runtime records into React views but does not decide what a surface looks like.

### 3. Presentation adapters and shells

Desktop, mobile, and embedded adapters interpret generic surfaces. Desktop owns window geometry, stacking, minimizing, and pointer interaction. Mobile owns navigation and route presentation. A shell selects the adapter, provides root outlets, and adds interface elements such as taskbars or launchers.

### 4. Applications

Applications own business logic and state. They receive stable identity and host capabilities. They may declare surface outlets when they intentionally host child presentations. They do not mutate runtime stores directly.

Dependencies should only point downward through public contracts. Applications depend on the React host API, not on desktop internals. Presentation adapters depend on generic surface contracts, not on individual applications. The core depends on neither.

## Runtime Invariants

The preproduction runtime should enforce these rules centrally:

1. Every application instance has a globally unique identifier.
2. Every application instance refers to a registered application type before it is rendered.
3. Every surface has a globally unique identifier.
4. Every surface refers to an existing application instance.
5. Every non-root surface refers to an existing parent surface.
6. The surface graph cannot contain cycles.
7. Sibling ordering is deterministic.
8. Visibility is explicit and cannot be represented by contradictory lists.
9. Opening an application and its first surface is one atomic operation.
10. Closing a surface and closing an application are different operations.
11. Closing a surface does not destroy application-owned state unless the application lifecycle also ends.
12. Closing an application removes all of its surfaces and emits one lifecycle event.
13. Renderers are projections and do not repair invalid runtime state silently.
14. Application state never enters the runtime snapshot unless an application supplies an optional opaque persistence adapter.
15. React component functions live in the registry, not in the serializable runtime snapshot.

## Public API Direction

Applications should receive a narrow host API with commands such as launching an application, opening another surface for an existing application, focusing a surface, changing visibility, closing a surface, and closing an application.

The host API should accept semantic inputs and enforce invariants. Applications should not coordinate separate application and window stores themselves.

The React package should expose stable components and hooks such as a runtime provider, an application view, a generic surface outlet, a runtime host hook, and read-only selectors. Desktop-specific exports should live under an explicit desktop entry point.

The first preproduction version does not need to solve every future use case. It does need to make invalid relationships difficult to create and to protect applications from internal store changes.

## Migration from the Prototype

The prototype should remain available as evidence of the experiments. The rewrite should be scaffolded beside it or on a dedicated branch rather than mechanically refactoring every experimental file.

### Phase 1: Freeze the model

Define the vocabulary, runtime records, commands, invariants, and lifecycle semantics. Decide precisely when an application exists independently of its surfaces.

### Phase 2: Build and test the headless core

Create one transactional runtime store for application and surface relationships. Test it without React. Cover launch, multiple surfaces, nested surfaces, focus ordering, visibility, moves, surface closure, application closure, and invalid graph operations.

### Phase 3: Add the React adapter

Implement the provider, registry, application resolver, host hook, generic surface outlet, and error boundaries. Verify that two surfaces can render one application identity while the application owns the shared state.

### Phase 4: Rebuild the desktop adapter

Adapt the existing `Window`, `AppWindowFrame`, taskbar controls, and immediate-child renderer to generic surfaces. Move position and sizing behavior behind the desktop presentation contract. Replace mouse-only behavior with pointer events and add keyboard and accessibility semantics.

### Phase 5: Prove presentation independence

Build one deliberately small second adapter, such as an embedded stack or mobile route renderer. It does not need polished UI. Its purpose is to prove that the core model is not secretly a desktop-only window model.

### Phase 6: Package preproduction

Publish explicit entry points, generated types, focused documentation, examples, invariant tests, and a migration example. Remove hard-coded application names and archive disconnected experiments outside the production source tree.

## Preproduction Acceptance Criteria

The architecture is ready for preproduction when all of the following are true:

- an application owns its state without placing that state in the runtime store;
- one application instance can be shown through two surfaces;
- both surfaces can observe the same application-owned state when the application chooses to share it;
- a surface can close without necessarily closing its application;
- an application can close and atomically remove all of its surfaces;
- an application can intentionally place an outlet for immediate child surfaces;
- the same runtime snapshot can be projected through at least two presentation adapters;
- no application imports a raw runtime store or a desktop-specific renderer;
- no core module imports React;
- no root application, shell, or workspace identifier is hard-coded in the runtime;
- lifecycle commands preserve all runtime invariants;
- the headless core is covered by deterministic tests;
- package consumers can understand the model from the README and this document without reading prototype internals.

## What Not to Carry Forward

The preproduction rewrite should not carry forward accidental constraints merely because the prototype currently depends on them.

Do not require application IDs and surface IDs to match. Do not encode identity as JSON strings. Do not use separate non-transactional stores for records that must change together. Do not represent one state through both active and hidden collections. Do not make applications import store factories or controller hooks. Do not call UI renderers drivers. Do not make desktop geometry part of the generic runtime. Do not make application state a prerequisite for using the runtime. Do not preserve dead experiments in the production module graph.

The prototype answered whether the idea could work. The next move is to make the idea legible, enforceable, testable, and suitable for other applications to build upon.

# Reference Scaffold

The following code is a proposed preproduction scaffold. TypeScript is used to make the contracts precise; the same boundaries can be implemented in JavaScript if necessary. These examples are a starting structure, not a claim that every API detail is final.

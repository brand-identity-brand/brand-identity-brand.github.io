since we are a slice of the universe, it is the "concious self" and the "environment" cmobined into the slice.
when trying to overcome mental obstacles it is useful to recreate the situation with imagination, not by purly imaging the sitution, but to only immagine the missing aspects of the situation. Immerse the current observed reality into the imagination land by only disregarding the non-nesseary parts. use the observed reality as a puzzle piece fitting into the imagination. For example, if a player has issue with free throws. during practise, have the player " assumes their current state ( emotion, court, ball, basket,), visualise the missing parts... bench players, fans, scoreboard, shot clock. The player is now shooting as if in game, but calm. The player needs to practise enough to remeber this "state of mind". 
when in game, the player should imagine it is just a practise. let both situation merge into their subconcious with this meditation.
